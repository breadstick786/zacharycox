this course has been a lot of ups and downs had lots of fun doing it but was stressful at times though this could be said for any course im presently doing or will do in the future it was a lot of fun putting together the websites with pictures cool words fonts and colors i added every single suggestion in some shape or form to my website from the peer review we did a few weeks back and personally am satisfied with how my website looks and overall enjoyed the course despite the few low points i had i look forward to my future courses
